Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables developers and AI tools to access structured design data directly from Figma files, streamlining the workflow for building web projects.

========================================================================
Basic Steps and Setup
Obtaining a Figma Access Token

Open Figma, click your profile picture → Settings → Security → Generate new token

It is recommended to set all permissions to Read/Write

Copy and save the obtained access token (e.g., figd_ ...)
========================================================================
Reference the file below and update the figma MCP code in the setting.json so it can access your Figma file to get data and build web projects:
\figmaMcp\figmaMcp\mcbTest\setting.json

Try asking the AI the following question:

- Try to connect to the Figma MCP.

- Could you please test this link "figma layout url" for connection?

-Create a complete HTML5, CSS, JS project including images using this Figma file ("figma layout url") in the specified folder. Put images in the "images" folder.
